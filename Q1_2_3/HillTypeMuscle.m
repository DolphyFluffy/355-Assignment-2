classdef HillTypeMuscle
    % Damped Hill-type muscle model adapted from Millard et al. (2013). The
    % dynamic model is defined in terms of normalized length and velocity.
    % To model a particular muscle, scale factors are needed for force, CE
    % length, and SE length.

            % complex (typically found from joint angles and musculoskeletal geometry).
            % (2) normalized_muscle_length: normalized length of the contractile element
            % (the state variable of the muscle model)
            % (3) resting_length_muscle: actual length (m) of muscle (CE) that corresponds to
            % normalized length of 1

            % normalized length of 1
